                <p>I like taking an idea and bringing it to life in the digital realm.</p>
                <p>I'm passionate about spreading opportunity, and creating a more equitable future.</p>
                <p>I never leave things half-done, and I obsess over the details. I like problem-solving in a creative, value-oriented way.</p>
